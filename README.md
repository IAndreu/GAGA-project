# GAGA-project
Gene family annotation pipeline

1. Conduct a first search of gene family members using homology-based methods
2. Identify the characteristic protein domain of the gene family
3. Create a database with the identified and curated sequences
4. Annotate and identify genes in the genome assembly
  Using BITACORA https://github.com/molevol-ub/bitacora
5. Validate the annotations
